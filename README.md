I will be building a Streamlit Web App using LangChain and OpenAI GPT-3 model.

* Streamlit is a popular Python library for building data science web apps
* OpenAI provides access to OpenAI’s GPT-3 language model.
# Steps in Building the Web App

1. Importing Libraries
2. Basic set up of the app (Header, subheader etc …)
3. Input widgets to interact with Front-end user (API KEY, Question widget …)
